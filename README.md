## Consensus AI in 2048 ##
This project serves as an exploration of artificial intelligence with the game 2048.
It also serves as my academic capstone for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

### Why? ###
Can weighted AI voting hold up to the standards of other 2048 algorithms? Can 
machine learning be applied to weigh input in a voting scenario? This project 
aims to answer these questions.
